    "It was once tedious to fumble through large amounts of data to infer solutions to complex problems. Today, we have a plethora of advanced techniques to have computers derive solutions from certain types of problems without explicitly programming them to do so. This is the general idea behind machine learning, but for those who wish for a stricter definition, the Werriam-Webster dictionary defines **machine learning** as the following:\n",

    "#### The SPAM Filter: Applications of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the first mainstream applications of machine learning date back to the early 1990s as spam filters for emails. This process was known as the \"SPAM or HAM\" algorithm. \"SPAM\" denotes spam emails, especially from supposed Nigerian princes asking for a few thousand dollars. \"HAM\" denotes emails that are legitimate, or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to machine learning, a programmer would manually write a lengthy list of more or less intuitive rules that search for given patterns in emails. This was a tedious experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparision to hardcoding a filter, the Machine learning SPAM filter detects spam emails by taking note of unusually frequent patterns of words in spam compared to a ham email examples. The filter then determines spam compared to ham examples and use those distinguishments to detect SPAM or HAM. This  python progam was much shorter and easier to maintain code and most likely more accurate as its sample size grew.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lectures, we had discussed logistic regression and determining the likelihood someone defaults on their credit card based on known data. Indeed, logistic regression would prove a suitable approach to solve the SPAM problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now discuss several machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, different data can be used to solve different problems. There may be certain requirements to answer different questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover three Machine Learning techniques: **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **reinforcment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.)  Supervised training\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Machine Learning uses a dataset that is used to build the model. This dataset is called the *training data* and includes the solutions or labels for each of the input data points. The training data gives you the mapping for a finite set of points and will help develop predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to generalize this mapping to population from which the training data originates and to derive the function that maps an input of the full set of data using only the training data. in other words, the training data set will be used to model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of supervised learning we will be using: *regression* and *classification*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**i.)** **Regression** (ex.: the linear regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be used to predict a specific quantity. Some examples were mentioned in class:\n",
    "+ Predicting ABC store sales from weather, rooms sold in Waikiki, special events in Waikiki, etc.\n",
    "+ Predicting how much some is likely to donate to fundraising campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "**ii.)** **Classification** (ex.: logistic regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used if the output is a class label and not a quantity, ex.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Predicting HAM/SPAM emails from an input email text.\n",
    "+ Classification animal in an image (ex. cat, dog, horse, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.) Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised training, data is unlabeled and the system tries to learn without supervision. This can result in a fuzzy objective of finding groups of samples that behave similarly. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some issues with using unsupervised learning. The evaluation of unsupervised learning results is often qualitative and/or indirect and may be difficult to know how well you're are doing. After all, there is no \"training data\" to condition the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning: common tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a few samples of unsupervised learning we covered in class.\n",
    "+ Identifying clusters of tweets that talk about similar things.\n",
    "+ Customer segmentation into: VALUE CONSCIOUS, LOYAL TO LOW COST, BRAND ADVOCATES\n",
    "+ Market Basked analysis (IE: how Safeway optimizes travel distance of customers by noting common pairs of purchases and distancing those items in hopes the extended walk encourages further purchases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.) Reinforcement learning\n",
    "This class of learning encompasses the algorithms that learn via reinforcement by \"rewarding\" good outcomes and \"penalizing\" bad outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples that incorporate reinforcement learning:\n",
    "+ Self-driving cars that are capable of sensing their environment and moving without input from a human.\n",
    "+ Agents that can play video games\n",
    "+ Systems that can control traffic light based on input from cameras and sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement learning - Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "For the autonomous car example, the model learns to associate images of road and data from sensors with possible speed and wheel displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, some examples that penalize bad outcomes and reward good outcomes can be the difference between life and death if we are discussing self-driving cars. We can hope this class of learning would use simulations or reside in a controlled setting if the penalties are particularly nasty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of reinforcment learning will then be something akin to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Crashing penalizes by providing low or negative points and getting to the right destination rewards high points. The model learns the types of situations that can lead to a crash and learns to avoid them.\n",
    "+ Robots that autonomously explore seafloor. You would hope that expensive machine makes it back intact. You would hope it knows where it has been and where to go to maximize the information collected, while staying safe (returning to base, not going where it cannot come back, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conventions used for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROWS in your data matrix or table are called *instances*, *observations*, *samples*, or *data points*. Every COLUMN is called a *feature* or a *variable*. We will refer to the number of input samples as $N$ and to the number of columns (or the number of features) as $D$, where $D$ the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that each data point can this be visualized in $D$ dimensions (or vector space). For example, data with 5 features is said to have 5 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data point can be written as a *vector* of size $D$. Our data with 5 features can be written as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x=(x_1,x_2,â€¦,x_5)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in supervised learning, your input will also be referred to as training data and refer to the labels or target values for the training data as target array, which will have the dimensions of (N, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Data types: Categorical, Ordinal, and Numerical\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance is a collection of values associated with the input features.\n",
    "* Ex: [218, 2026, 2.3] for the features [\"age in days\"; \"Weight in grams\"; \"avg scale area in cm\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Values are also known as data types. Three classes of common data types are **categorical**, **ordinal** and **numerical**, which we will define and describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.) Categorical:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite, no ordering assumed.\n",
    "Usually encoded as numbers (0, 1, 2) but the order is not relevant. These are just to represent classifications. Thus, cannot be operated on as a sum, sqrt, etc over a feature encoding men, women and children as (0,1,2).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ex. Adult Man, Adult woman, Child, Baby\n",
    "* Ex. Blue, Red, Yellow, Green\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.) Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as categorical data, but with a natural ordering. Usually encoded as numbers (0, 1, 2), but the *order is relevant*. For example, a purchasing power of 2 is better than 0, but there is no scale.\n",
    "order-relevant operations are possible but not algebraic operations such as mean, sqrt, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ex. Purchasing power (low, average, high)\n",
    "* Ex. Months (January < Feburary < March < etc.)\n",
    "* Ex. How much someone likes something on a scale from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.) Numerical\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data is data that is expressed with digits as opposed to letters or words. These values can have units. As we've done before, it's common to bring data to he same scale for some algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "When inspecting the data, skewed distributions and outliers can be problematic, such as when calculating the mean. Algebraic operations are possible, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ex. Height in cm\n",
    "* Ex. weight in Kg\n",
    "* Ex. Average height in inches"

    "#### The groundwork for Encoding with Machine Learning\n",
    "   \n",
    "After determining wich *class problem* you are working with (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning), you need to *structure the input(s) and output(s)* into a compatible format with the type of machine learning you are working with. (This may involve adding new input features.) To do this you need to take into consideration the type of algorithm you will be using to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hint: When deciding on an algorithm that will fit the problem, take into consideration the desired output(s) of the problem. Can any of them be used to train your model(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The the need or process of, input(s) that need to be transformed to work with ML algorithms is called feature engineering or data encoding. *A good encoding is one which preserves contextual similarity between data points.* However, this can be challenging. Examples of data that would need to be transformed into a workable input are; sound, DNA sequences, images, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "You could encode a song as a vector( instead of a single numerical value), Encoding Images of Digits To encoded image, representing single digits, we can digitize a bounded box centered around the digit\n",
    "\n",
    "You could encode emails and text to filter out spam from ham. Your input or set of features will be all the set of possible words to indicate a spam email. Those features will include but are not limited to a subset of commonly occurring words, or the presence/absence and frequency of each word. Typically this feature of subset can be hundreds or thousands of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could encode the image of a number, by converting it into a matrix where each pixel is stored as a real number representing the grayscale pixel. As seen below.The matrix, the right image, can be unrolled and represented as a vector of [nm, 1], which would look something like; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0.6, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 1, ...]. Using *Euclidean Distance* (\"ordinary\" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space(2D or 3D)) you can find the distance between vectors. This is useful for ML to recognize other number 1s, since number ones are all fairly similar even across handwriting and fonts. \n",
    "![](images/coral.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example of encoding a number onto a grid based on the grayscale is useful for ML, when dealing with visually similar images. However, it does not work week for things that have more variables to them. For example, brain coral can vary in color and texture. In Order to encode them and have a program recognize a picture of brain coral, other features such as shape and pattern need to be taken into account. \n",
